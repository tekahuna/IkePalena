# Ike Palena — Public Releases

This repository distributes **public release bundles** and their **public provenance artifacts**.

## Integrity

Each release includes:

- `provenance/manifest.json` — bundle and payload SHA256 anchors  
- `provenance/integrity_sweep.json` — verification evidence  
- `provenance/VAULT_POINTERS.json` — archival anchor references  

GitHub is a distribution layer only.  
Canonical integrity is hash-anchored upstream.
